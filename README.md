# SONAR_Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction
A ML project done in my second year of college. I have made a model which can predict either if it is a rock or a mine with the SONAR data that is provided.

Dataset Used: Sonar Data 

In this model our aim is to determine whether there is a rock or a mine underneath based on the sonar data. I have used Logistic Regression Model and trained it to make the predictions. Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable. The most common logistic regression models a binary outcome i.e., something that can take two values such as true/false, yes/no, and so on. In this model it either has to predict whether there is a rock or a mine.

Workflow of this project: Dataset->Data Preprocessing->Train Test Split->Logistic Regression Model->Trained Logistic Regression Model
